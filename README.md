# React Native FAQ Library

This FAQ library was created to simplify the process of adding frequently asked questions to React Native applications. It aims to provide an easy-to-use and customizable solution for developers to enhance user experience by addressing common queries and concerns within the app.

The primary goals of this library include:
- Streamlining the integration of FAQs into React Native apps.
- Offering a user-friendly interface for managing and organizing questions and answers.
- Allowing developers to customize the FAQ component's appearance and behavior to match their app's design and requirements.
